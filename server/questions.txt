Which of the following is true about physical RAM?
It is not volatile.
It performs faster than the CPU.
It stores all installed programs in memory.

D
What is a difference between primary & secondary storage?
Primary storage devices generally have more capacity than secondary storage devices.
Secondary storage works closely with the processor, while primary storage does not.
Primary storage requires power to retain its contents, while secondary storage does not.
There is no difference â€” the terms are interchangeable.
C
Which of the following is Moore's Law?
The number of transistors in a chip will double every 18 months.
The speed of a processor will double every 2 years.
The number of transistors in a chip will double every year.
Quantum computing is inevitable.
A
What is the purpose of the branch predictor within a CPU?
It utilises machine learning to predict all of the user's actions.
It attempts to guess the most likely next instruction and determine its reliance on previous instructions.
It is a temporary storage area.
It enables two programs to be run simultaneously on a single thread.
