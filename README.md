# How To Play

## Introductory Page

When opening the website, you will be greeted with an introductory page explaining the rules of the game and allowing you to customise your game.

![Untitled](README-images/Untitled%201.png)

In the **options bar** above, you can customise:

- **The number of questions you want in the game.**
- **Whether you want to include preset questions or not.**
  - If you check this option, up to 20 pre-written questions from the topics Storage and Processing & Control will be included. If you choose more than 20 questions, the remaining questions will be generated by Google Bard.
    - For example, if you check the option and choose 50 questions, 20 will be preset and 30 will be AI-generated.
  - If you **do not** check the option, all questions will be AI-generated and will span all topics in the syllabus.

When you’re ready to start playing, press the purple “Start” button!

## Loading Page

<aside>
‼️ In the rare case that loading takes more time than indicated, please refresh the page and try again.

</aside>

If you have requested any AI-generated questions, there will be a short loading period while the program fetches questions.

It takes about 0.9 seconds to load each question, so loading times span from 9 seconds to 90 seconds. Sometimes, the questions will load in less time than is indicated!

After the questions are fetched, the game automatically starts.

## Gameplay & Rules
